## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher (8.0+ recommended)
- MySQL 5.7 or higher (8.0+ recommended)
- Apache or Nginx web server
- PHP extensions: PDO, PDO_MySQL, mbstring, openssl

### Installation Steps

1. **Download and Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone or download the project
   git clone https://github.com/noah-s-dev/php-forum.git
   cd php-forum

   # Set proper permissions
   chmod 755 public/
   chmod 644 public/*.php
   chmod 644 config/*.php
   chmod 644 includes/*.php
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Create database
   CREATE DATABASE php_forum CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

   -- Import the schema
   mysql -u username -p php_forum < sql/forum_setup.sql
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   
   a. **Database Configuration**
      Edit `config/database.php` with your database credentials:
      ```php
      define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
      define('DB_NAME', 'php_forum');
      define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
      define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
      ```
   
   b. **URL Configuration**
      The system automatically detects the base URL and project path. If your project is located at `http://localhost/php-forum`, the system will automatically configure the URLs correctly. No manual configuration is needed for the base URL.
      
      The `SITE_URL` in `config/config.php` is automatically set based on your server configuration and project location.

## 📖 Usage
